# 🐵 **Landing Game**

A **2D platformer game** built using **Phaser.js**, where players control a monkey navigating through challenging levels, collecting bananas, managing fuel, and avoiding obstacles. The game focuses on creating an engaging experience with dynamic physics, animations, and interactive gameplay.

---

## 📚 **Framework and Development**

The game is developed using **Phaser.js**, a robust framework for creating 2D games in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. Phaser.js offers powerful tools like physics engines and animation utilities, simplifying game logic and object interactions.

## 💡 **Challenges Faced**

1. **Physics Engine Selection**:
   - Transitioned from **Arcade Physics** to drawing custom boundaries for complex collisions.

2. **Asset Management**:
   - Manually cropped images for spritesheets and animated assets.

3. **Animations**:
   - Implemented monkey movement animations with direction-specific frames.

4. **Landing Space Logic**:
   - Logic for detecting the monkey's landing required fine-tuning to ensure seamless gameplay.
